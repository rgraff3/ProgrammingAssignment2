## Functions are objects which perform a specific action.  Kind of like a mini program within a program.

## This function is modelled off the example, but instead of creating a vector and which can cache its mean
## this function creates a matrix and caches its inverse so we don't have to run it's inverse every time we want to use it.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getinverse<- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## As described in the assignment, "This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then `cacheSolve` should retrieve the inverse from the cache."

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Returns a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- inverse(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
