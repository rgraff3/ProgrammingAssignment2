## Functions are objects which perform a specific action.  Kind of like a mini program within a program.

## As described in the assignment, "This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse."

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## As described in the assignment, "This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then `cacheSolve` should retrieve the inverse from the cache."

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
